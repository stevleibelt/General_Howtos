# Logseq

Logseq is a personal note system.

Key feature is to have a place for your daily journal application that simplifies linking to create a graph based database of knowledge while typing.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

There is a built in Help page listing all available keystrokes.   
Open the right panel by pressing `t` and `r`.  
Select Keyboard shortcuts.

### The following list is a list of my preferred keystroks

| Keystrokes | Description |

| ENTER | Create new block |
| SHIFT+ENTER | New line in current block |
| TAB | Indent block |
| SHIFT+TAB | Outdent block |
| CTRL+a | Select parent block |
