#extract method
You have a lot of code that can be grouped together.
-> Turn code into a method named to explain the purpose of the method.

##example
Before
<php>
    echo ‘name: ‘ $user->getName() . PHP_EOL;
    echo ‘amount: ‘ $user->getAmount() . PHP_EOL;
</php>

After
<php>
$this->printDetails($user);

function printDetails(User $user) 
{
    echo ‘name: ‘ $user->getName() . PHP_EOL;
    echo ‘amount: ‘ $user->getAmount() . PHP_EOL;
}
</php>

##steps
- create new method with fitting name (what it does not how)
- copy extracted code into new method
- look for variables in the scope of the method and add it as parameter to the method
- look for returned variables and return them (as single property, array, object)
- replace extracted code with methodcall
- run tests

#inline method
The code in your method is doing more than its name.
-> Move the called code into the body of the caller and remove the called method
-> It is possible that you split the big code up into smaller pieces afterwards

##example
Before
<php>
    $anotherNumber = $class->getAnotherNumber();
    $b = $a + $anotherNumber;
</php>

After
<php>
    $b = $a + $class->getAnotherNumber();
</php>

##steps
- verify the method is not overwritten by subclasses
- find all calls to the method
- replace calls with method body
- run tests
- remove method

#inline temp variable
A simple expression is assigned once to a temporary variable and is used as return value or as validation.
-> Replace variable with simple expression

##example
Before
<php>
    public function isOverbooked() 
    {
        $isOverbooked = count($this->travellers) > $numberOfSeats;
        return $isOverbooked;
    }
</php>

After
<php>
    public function isOverbooked() 
    {
        return count($this->travellers) > $numberOfSeats;
    }
</php>

#replace temp with query
You are using temporary variables to store and hold an expression result
-> Extract a new method and replace all references to the variable with the method call

##example
Before
<php>
    public function getPrice()
    {
        $basePrice = $this->price * $this->quantity;
        $discount = ($basePrice > 1000) ? .9 : 1;
        return $basePrice * $discount;
    }
</php>

After
<php>
    public function getPrice()
    {
        return $basePrice * $discount;
    }

    private function getDiscount()
    {
        return ($this->getBasePrice > 1000) ? .9 : 1;
    }

    private function getBasePrice()
    {
        return $this->price * $this->quantity;
    }
</php>

##steps
- look for variables that is assigned once
- extract right-hand-side of the assignment and move into a private method
- run tests
- replace variable with methodcall
- run tests

#introduce explaining variable
You have a complicated expression.
-> Put the expression into a temporary variable with a clear name.

##example
Before
<php>
    public function getPrice()
    {
        return $this->price * $this->quantity - 
            max($this->quantity - 150, 0) * $this->price * 0.1;
    }
</php>

After
<php>
    public function getPrice()
    {
        $basePrirce = $this->price * $this->quantity;
        $discount = max($this->quantity - 150, 0) * $this->price * 0.1;

        return $basePrice - $discount;
    }
</php>

##steps
- declare a variable
- assign result of expression on it
- run tests

#split temporary variable
A temporary vaiable is assigned more then once.
-> Declare and assign a separate variable for each assignment.

##example
Before
<php>
    public function calculateTotal()
    {
        $total = 0;
        $total += $this->getPrice();
        $total += $this->getBonus();

        return $total;
    }
</php>

After
<php>
    public function calculateTotal()
    {
        $total = 0;
        $price = $this->getPrice();
        $total = $this->getBonus();

        $total = $price + $total;

        return $total;
    }
</php>

##steps
- validate that variable is not used as a iterator or something similar
- change the name of the variable at its first declaration
- run tests
- repeat change naming for each declaration and run tests

#replace method with method object
You have a long method and you can not apply "extract method".
-> Create a new class, instantiate an object and create a method. Then refactor it.

##example
Before
<php>
    public function foo($firstValue, $secondValue)
    {
        $tempOne = $firstValue * $secondValue;
        $tempTwo = $firstValue - $this->getDiscount();

        if (($tempOne - $tempTwo) % 2) {
            return $firstValue - 2;
        }

        return $secondValue + 4;
    }
</php>

After
<php>
    public function foo($firstValue, $secondValue)
    {
        $foo = new Foo($firstValue, $secondValue, $this->getDiscount());

        return $foo->compute();
    }

class FooCalculator
{
    private $firstValue;
    private $secondValue;
    private $discount;

    public function __construct($firstValue, $secondValue, $discount)
    {
        $this->firstValue = $firstValue;
        $this->secondValue = $secondValue;
        $this->discount = $discount;
        $this->setup();
    }

    public function compute()
    {
        if (($this->tempOne - $this->tempTwo) % 2) {
            return $this->firstValue - 2;
        }

        return $this->secondValue + 4;
    }

    private function setup()
    {
        $this->tempOne = $this->firstValue * $this->secondValue;
        $this->tempTwo = $this->firstValue - $this->discount();
    }
}
</php>

##steps
- create a new class named as the method
- give new class an attribute for the original object and for each variable or parameter
- write a constructor to accept source object and paramenters
- create a "compute()" method in the new class
- copy the body of the old method into the new one
- prefix variable calls with "this->"
- replace old method with new object instance creation and call of the "compute()" method
- decompose the "compute()" method as much as needed 

#substitue algorithm
You want to replace an algorithm with another.
->Replace body of the method with new algorithm

##steps
- prepare your alternative algorithm
- run tests
- use both algorithms to run tests and debugging
- compare speed and readability

#move method
A class method is more used by methods of another class then by the class it is defined
-> Create a new method in the other class and copy code. Decide if you want to duplicate the code or create a delegation to the new method or remove it.

##steps
- write unittests for the class
- identify the method and move it
- observe the attributes used inside the method and move them also or pass them as paraemters
- validate that the method is not extended in subclasses or extends a superclass
- write a unittest for the destination class
- move the method in the destination class, most likly you can change the name to better fitting one
- run unittests
- change source method (should call the new method now)
- run unittests
- decide what to do with the source method (remove it or keep the delegation in)

#move property
A property of a class describes a feature of another class instead of a feature of the current class.
-> Create a new property and change all calls to the new class property.

##example
Before
<php>
class User
{
    private $generalDiscount = 0.01;

    public function getPrice()
    {
        return ($this->price * $this->generalDiscount);
    }
}
</php>

After
<php>
class UserType
{
    private $generalDiscount = 0.01;

    public function setGeneralDiscount($discount)
    {
        $this->generalDiscount = $discount;
    }

    public function getGeneralDiscount()
    {
        return $this->generalDiscount;
    }
}

//general discount is injected by user factory
class BasicUser extends UserType
{
    public function getPrice()
    {
        return ($this->price * $this->getGeneralDiscount());
    }
}
</php>

##steps
- write unittest for source and destination class
- define new property in destination class 
- create getter/setter methods in destination class
- run tests
- replace property by referencing to the destination class method
- run tests

#extract class
A class has responsibilities for more than one class.
-> Create a new class and move properties and methods into it, that doesn't belong to the source class.

##example
A class "book" holds informations of the an "author" (first name, last name, address).
-> create class "author" and inject it in class "book".

Before
<php>
class User
{
    private $city;
    private $zip;

    public function getAddress()
    {
        return $this->zip . ' ' . $this->city;
    }
}
</php>

After
<php>
class Address
{
    private $city;
    private $zip;

    public function __construct($zip, $city)
    {
        $this->city = $city;
        $this->zip = $zip;
    }

    public function getCity()
    {
        return $this->city;
    }

    public function getZip()
    {
        return $this->zip;
    }

    public function toString()
    {
        return $this->getZip() . ' ' . $this->getCity();
    }
}
class User
{
    private $city;
    private $zip;

    public function getAddress()
    {
        return $this->address->toString();
    }
}
</php>

##steps
- create unittest for source class.
- decide which properties and|or methods to extract
- create unittest for new class
- create new class
- store an instance of the new class in the constructor of the old class
- use "move property" method to move each property in the new class
- run tests
- use "move method" method to move each method in the new class
- run tests
- decide how to handle the new class in the calls of the old class (move old calls to new class?)

#inline class
A class isn't doing very much
-> Move all its features into another class and delete it.

##steps
- write unittest for source and destination class
- use "move property" and|or "move method" to move property and|or method from source to destination
- replace calls with calls to destination class
- run all tests

#hide delegate
A client is calling a delegate class of an object.
-> Create methods to hide the delegate.

##example
A class "author" is injected into a class "book" and only has the properties "firstName" and "lastName".

Before
<php>
class User
{
    private $city;
    private $zip;

    public function getCity()
    {
        return $this->city;
    }
}
</php>

After
<php>
class Address
{
    private $city;
    private $zip;

    public function __construct($zip, $city)
    {
        $this->city = $city;
        $this->zip = $zip;
    }

    public function getCity()
    {
        return $this->city;
    }

    public function getZip()
    {
        return $this->zip;
    }

    public function toString()
    {
        return $this->getZip() . ' ' . $this->getCity();
    }
}
class User
{
    private $city;
    private $zip;

    public function getCity()
    {
        return $this->address->getCity();
    }
}
</php>

##steps
- write unittest
- declare methods to hide the delegate methods from the client
- run tests
- change all calls from clients to the new delegate method
- run tests
- remove unused methods

#remove the middle man.
A class is doing to much simple delegation.
-> Get the cliend to call the delegate directly.

##steps
- write tests
- add new method in the server class
- run tests
- change all client calls to the new server method
- remove delegate methods
- adapt server class tests
- run all tests

#introduce foreign method
A server class needs an additional method but can't be modified.
-> Create a method in the client class with the server class as first parameter.

##steps
- write test for client class
- run tests
- create method in client class
- run tests
