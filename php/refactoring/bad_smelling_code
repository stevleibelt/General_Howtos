#first signs of bad smells
- difficult to understand/read or following the logic of code
- a lot of commented lines
- sensation of fear when you have to implement new features
- a lot of files with thousands of thousands of lines of code
- hard to create testdata
- procedural code

#examples

##duplicated code

###example
class BasicUser extends User 
{
    public function getGreetingName()
    {
        return $this->getFirstName() . ' ' . $this->getLastName();
    }
}

class AdminUser extends User 
{
    public function getGreetingName()
    {
        return $this->getFirstName() . ' ' . $this->getLastName();
    }
}

###steps to solve
- move duplication into parent class.

###refactoring strategies
- extract method
- pull up field
- form template method
- subsitute algorithm

##method with a size of many lines

###steps to solve
- extract lines of code that can be readed as "a block of code" into a new method
- find a name of the method that does not explain how it works, but what it does
- repeat this until you can read the method and understand the flow

###refactoring strategies
- extract method
- move method

##classes with a size of many lines, properties or methods

###steps to solve
- create blocks of properties that are belonging together
- move this blocks into classes
- inject this classes (if needed) with setter and getter methods into current class
- if some properties are only used by a special circicumstance, move them into a subclass that extends the current class

###refactoring strategies
- extract class
- extract subclass

##methods with many parameters

###example

public function sendMailToUser($firstName, $lastName, $emailAddress, ...)
{
//CODE//
}

public function sendMailToUser(User $user)
{
//use $user->getFirstName() and so on//
}

###refactoring strategies
- replace parameter with method
- replace parameter with object
- preserve whole object
- ontroduce parameter object

##multiple changes to introduce a new feature of fix a bug

###example

class Storage
{
    public function findAll()
    {
        $connection = mysql_connect(...

        //CODE//
    }

    public function findOne()
    {
        $connection = mysql_connect(...

        //CODE//
    }
}

###steps to solve
- extract method into a general method or new class

###refactoring strategies
- extract class

##classes that are doing small things like a class for a property

###example

class User
{
    public function getStreetname()
    {
        return $this->streetname->getValue();
    }

    public function getStreetnumber()
    {
        return $this->streetnumber->getValue();
    }
}

class User
{
    public function getStreetname()
    {
        return $this->address->getStreetname();
    }
}

class User
{
    public function getStreetname()
    {
        return $this->streetname;
    }
}

###steps to solve it
- move method to responsible class
- move property into current class

###refactoring strategies
- move method
- move property/field
- inline class

##a class is responsible for another class -> a class process data of another class

###steps to solve
- extract and move methods to responsible class

###refactoring strategies
- move method
- extract method

##many attributes have to change in different classes when new feature is inserted

###steps to solve
- extract attributes into a new class
- inject class into classes that are using this attributes

###refactoring strategies
- extract class
- introduce parameter object
- preserve whole object

##to many primitive types (string, integer) are used (more then once in the code) to represent certain data

###example

$resultArray = $database->fetch('SELECT first_name, last_name FROM user where id = ' . $id);

echo 'Hello ' . $resultArray['first_name'] . ' ' . '$resultArray['last_name'];

class User
{
    public function getGreeting()
    {
        return $this->firstName . ' ' . $this->lastName;
    }

    public function __toString()
    {
        return $this->getGreeting();
    }
}

echo 'Hello ' . $user->getGreeting();
echo 'Hello ' . $user;

###steps to solve it
- replace data value with an object
- replace usage in code with new object

###refactoring strategies
- replace data value with object
- replace type code with class
- replace type code with subclasses
- replace type code with state/strategy

##switch statements used more then once in the code
## the switch changes the behaviour of an object based on given parameter(s)

###steps to solve
- extract switch in a method
- move new method in the fitting class

###refactoring strategies
- extract method
- move method
- replace type code with subclass
- replace type code with state/strategy
- replace conditional with polymorphism
- introduce nullObject

##lazy class - a class that it not used that often
## each class has a cost of maintenance -> sometimes it is usefull to move it back in the class

##refactoring strategies
- collapse hierarchy
- incline class

##remove speculative (maybe good for the future) code

###example

A abstract class is extended only by one class.
A method is only used for testing

###refactoring strategies
- collapse hierarchy
- inline class
- remove parameter
- rename method

##temporary field

###example

class Customer
{
    private $isCompany;
    private $companyName;  //is only used if Customer is a company
    private $firstName;
    private $lastName;
}


Class Customer
{
    private $firstName;
    private $lastName;
}

Class Company extends Customer
{
    private $companyName;
}

###refactoring strategies
- extract subclass
- introduce nullObject (abstract class)

##data class
## happens when a class with a lot of public attributes have to reduce the publicity of their attributes

###refactoring strategies
- encapsulate filed (create getter and setter)
- encapsulate collection
- remove setting method

##comments

###steps to solve
- replace comment with a method where name express what the method does not how
- invoke the method where we want to put the comment

###refactoring strategies
- extract method
- preserve whole object
- introduce parameter object

##procedural code

###steps to solve
- cover current code with unittest (with all know behaviours)
- move code to object oriented code

###refactorie strategies
- big refactoring
