# technique (the five steps)

* create a list with things you want/need to do
* choose on item from the list and work on this for 25 minutes
* make a break for five minutes
* go on with the same item or an other item
* do a longer break (15 up to 20 minutes) after four iterations

# basic idea

* try to stay "in the flow" or "focused" at least for 25 minutes
* if there is an interruption, put it off until the end of your current iteration
* if there is an interruption you can not shift, break your current iteration but note it down

# how to convince somebody for this technique

* the interruption only has to wait 12.5 minutes in average
* you get things done
* you are still open for changes

# how to convince yourself for this technique

* manage distractions
    * log them
    * order them according to their real priority
    * figure out that things can wait often
* instead of getting disrupted, you can decide the time of an disruption
    * you won't lose your focus if you say quickly "I will come back to you in X minutes"
* instead of working against the time, you work with the time
* eliminate burnout and gain health since your are not in full time battle mode
