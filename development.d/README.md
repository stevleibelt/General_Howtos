## Simple Guideline of coding

* Work in small batches, solving one problem at a time
* Iterate rapidly including continuous testing, code review, refactoring and integration testing
* Create modular architecture design to limit the blast radius of changes and to ease up finding them when shit hits the fan
* Focus on end-to-end outcomes insteaf of role or technology specialisms
* Work autonome to be able make timely decisions on the ground instead of have to trigger a chain of commands (ask multiple persons for a yes)
