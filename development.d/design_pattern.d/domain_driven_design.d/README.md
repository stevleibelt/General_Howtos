# domain driven design

DDD is a set of philosophically concepts to build software for complex domains.
Core questions are strategic patterns of integrating bounded contexts, covering tactical patterns for creating effective domain models and delves design patterns you can applay to utilize the domain model and build effective applications.

DDD tries to explain why the language, collaboration and context are the most important facts in DDD.

# steps

* distiling the problem domain
* focusing on the core domain
* model-driven design
* domain model implementation patterns
* maintaining the integrity of domain models with bounded context
* context mapping
* application architecture

# database

# notes

* focus on solving the customers problem and not focus on using the latest technologies
* think of the behaviour first when modeling your domain
* do not think about the tools (database, etc.)
