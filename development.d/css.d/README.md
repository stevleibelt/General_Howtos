## Units

There are two basic types, absolut and relative units. As long as possible, you should set absolut units on the root element and relative elements on the child elements.

`px`, `pt` and `cm` are absolut units.

`rem`, `em`, `vh`, `vw`, `ch` and `%` are relative units.

`rem` stands for "root element measurement". This means that if the font size of the root element is `16px`, `2rem` is equal to `32px`.

`em` stands for "element measurement". This means that if the font size of the parent element is `8px`, `2em` is equal to `16px`.

`%` This means that if the font size of the paremt element is `10px`, `10%` is equal to `1px`.

`vh` stands for "viewport height (in percentage)". This means that if you set height to `100vh`, the element covers all the viewport hight (full hight of the browser window hight).

`vw` stands for "viewport width (in percentage)". This means that if you set width to `100vw`, the element covers all the viewport width (full hight of the browser window width).

`ch` stands for "character hight". This means that if you set width to `1ch`, the has the hight of the character `0` of the current font.

`px` stands for "pixel".
