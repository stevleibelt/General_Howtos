# General how to and knowledge base of artodeto

This repository is free as in freedom, not as in beer.

This repository is mostly just for [me](https://stev.leibelt.de). I am adding, structuring, removing or updating content to expand my knowledge.

Updating and removing is never done in a frequency as adding stuff. Glad, mature software is not following googles principle of "I don't give a shit what I've told you yesterday, this is the api". It is heavily open source based, since open source software is the only way preventing us from "I have this magical file but I don't know how to open it/I am not allowed to open it because of licencing issues" and from converting ourselfs to "I don't know it since I don't have the money to pay the licence".

Every link is added with a date (old way) or a datetime (newer way) to show when the link is added.
