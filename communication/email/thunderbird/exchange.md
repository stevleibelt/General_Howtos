# How To Connect Thunderbird To Exchange

First of all, don't expect miracles, microsoft is jelling "fuck you" to all existing standards.
Calendar is something that is working, but only reading. 

## E-Mail

### Right after the initial start

* Start Thunderbird
* Install the following extensions **before** setting up an exchange e-mail-account
    * `Eule f端r Exchange` - Please, donate or buy a subscription because this company is working their ass of to keep exchange usable!
    * `Provider f端r Exchange ActiveSync`
    * `TbSync`

## Setup an exchange account

* `Setup existing E-Mail-Address`
    * `Your full name`: `<First name> <Last name>`
    * `E-Mail-Addresse`: `<email address>`
    * `Password`: `<password>`
    * Set a checkmark at `Save password`
    * `Your username`: `<domain name>\<domain account name>`

## Setup S/MIME-Encryption / certificate

* `Settings` -> `Dataprivacy & security` -> `Manage certificates...`
* `Your certificates` -> `import`
* Choose your `*.p12` File
* `OK`
* `Account-Settings`
* Sorry but at this point, there is a missing link
