# colors of the cables 

* green / yellow    - protection conductor (Schutzleiter) / pE
* blue              - neutral wire (Neutralleiter) / N
* brown / black     - phase (Außenleiter/Polleiter) / L

# where to cable what by a lamp/light

* don't secure the protection conductor with a luster terminal (Lysterklemme)
* connect the phase with the middle contact of the light (never ever connect on the ring!)
* connect the neutral wire with the ring of the light
