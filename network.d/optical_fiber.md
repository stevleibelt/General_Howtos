# Supported Modes

* fibers supporting only one wavelength are called single- or mono-mode fibers
    * better to carry signal over long distance (typically yellow coating)
* fibers supporting multiple wavelenghts are called multi- or poly-mode fibers
    * better to carry more bandwith on a smaller distance

# GBIC

* *G*iga*B*it *I*nterface *C*onverter
* standard to hot-swap transceivers in network equipment
* keeps the switch "alive" and usable if the physical media changes
* mini-GBIC are also know as [SFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_form-factor_pluggable_transceiver) (*S*mall *F*form-factor *P*luggable transceiver)
