# find by time

* -amin     -   access in last n minutes
* -atime    -   access time last n*24 hours
* -cmin     -   file status changed in n minutes
* -ctime    -   change time last n\*24 hours
* -mtime    -   modified time last n\*24 hours (n = n+1 day, -n = older than, +n = newer than)

```
find . -mtime 0             # find files modified between now and 1 day ago
                            # (i.e., within the past 24 hours)
find . -mtime -1            # find files modified less than 1 day ago
                            # (i.e., within the past 24 hours, as before)
find . -mtime 1             # find files modified between 24 and 48 hours ago
find . -mtime +1            # find files modified more than 48 hours (two days) ago
find . -mtime +3            # find files modified more than 72 hours (three days) ago

find . -mmin +5 -mmin -10   # find files modified between
                            # 6 and 9 minutes ago
```

## gnu find

```
find . -newerat '2 hours ago'   # find files accessed last two hours
find . -newerct '2 hours ago'   # find files created last two hours
find . -newermt '2 hours ago'   # find files modified last two hours
```

```

find . ! -newerct '2 hours ago'   # find files created more than two hours
find . ! -newermt '2 hours ago'   # find files modified more than two hours
```

## find number of files that are created and older than four hours

```
find . ! -newerct '4 hours ago' | wc | awk '{print $1}'
```

# find by permission

```
find . -perm -o=r
```

# find by size

```
find . -size +1G
```

# find by owner

```

## delete all .gz and rotated files
