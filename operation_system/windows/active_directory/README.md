### Example

Give is a printer with the name "cobraLazer" in the unit "IT" for the domain "compu.global.hyper.meganet.
The fully qualified name is "CN=cobraLazer,OU=IT,DC=compu,DC=global,DC=hyper,DC=meganet".

## Group Policy

* centralized managemend and configuration of operation systems, applications and user settings in an active directory
* a set of group policies is alled a group policy object
* without an active directory, a local group policy (LGPO/LocalGPO) can be used stand alone
* refresh of the policies
    * in a domain, every five minutes
    * not in a domain, every 90 minutes with a random 30 minutes offset
* which settings are applied when
    * on bootup/user log in: automated software installation, drive mappings, startup scripts, logon scripts
    * else: all other things
* group policies are processed (applied) in the following order (if there are multiple policies per step, they are processed in the order set by the administrator):
    * local - policies stored on this machine
    * site - grouped computers by their location (physical proximity)
    * domain - sites in a domain
    * organizational unit - grouped computers as a logical unit (administrator, writers, etc.)
* policy settings are inherited
* applying a policy can be controlled by using the [Windows Management Instrumention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation) for filtering (only apply this policy for pcs with that amount of memory or cpu ...)
* with windows 8, following enhacements where released
    * [gpupdate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/gpupdate) - typically called as `gpupdate /force` - forces a group policy update every 10 minutes with an random offset
    * [gpresult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/gpresult) - typically called as `gpresult /R`, displays result set of policy (RSoP) for [remote] user and computer
        * `gpresult /f /h current_gpresult.html`, exports the used gpo's, its state (failed or not) and the time it took
        * Or `rsop.msc`
    * group policy infrastructure status - reports if a GPO is not replicated correctly over all DC's
    * group policy results report - now times the execution of individual compontens when doing an group policy update

## How To

* List all AD-groups of current user
	* `gpresult /r`
	* `whoami /groups`

## PowerShell

### Get all properties for a user

```bash
#if you know the samUserName
Get-ADUser -Identity <samUserName> -Properties *

#if you have to search for name
Get-ADUser -Filter "Name -like 'bo*'" -Properties *
```

### Get all users in the group admin

```bash
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity admin | SELECT SamAccountName, Name, ObjectClass
```

### Get current active domain controller

```bash
#by using pure powershell
([ADSI]”LDAP://RootDSE”).dnshostname
#by using the ActiveDirectory powershell module
Get-ADDomainController -Discover
```

### Set user property

```bash
#works mostly
Set-ADUser -Identity johndoe -EmailAddress "john_doe@company.com"

#for some special properties like pager, you have to use replace
Set-ADUser -Identity johndoe -Replace @{pager = 123-456 789}
```
