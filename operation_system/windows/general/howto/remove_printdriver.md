# This is connected to the generic error `0x00000057`

## Basic knowledge

* You have to know how to start and stop the printer spooler service
    * `WIN`+`R` -> `cmd` -> `SHIFT`+`ENTER` (to start it as administrator)
        * `net start spooler`
        * `net stop spooler`
    * \_or
    * `WIN`+`S`-> `services.msc` -> `SHIFT`+`ENTER` (to start is as administrator)
        * search for `Printer Spooler`
        * rightclick on it and either choose `start` or `stop`
* Open the `printer management`
    * `WIN`+`s` -> `printermanagement.msc` -> `SHIFT`+`ENTER` (to start it as administrator)
* Open the printui command
    * `WIN`+`R` -> `cmd` -> `SHIFT`+`ENTER` (to start it as administrator)
    * `printui.exe`
* Where are the drivers stored on your printserver (if needed)
    * `\\<print server>\print$\x64\PCC`
* Last but not least, there are multiple ways
* Drivers are located in `C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository`
* Not finished print jobs are stored in `C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS`. It can be that you have to stop the spooler and empty this directory to remove driver lock

### first solution

* stop the print spooler service
* open `printer management`
* naviagte to `Print Server` -> `<Computer Name> (local)` -> All Drivers 
* right click on the printer driver you want to delete and select `delete`

### second solution

* go to `Devices and Printers` and remove the printer
* stop the `print spooler` service
* open regedit and go to the following key:
* `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors\`
* re-name all print processors you see here, such as: Winprint to Winprint.old, Hpcpp107 to Hpcpp107.old, and so on â€¦
* start the `print spooler` service
* open `printer management` and remove the full printer driver package
* open the registry again and go again to the following key:
* `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors\`
* rename all print processors to `OLD` or `<current date>`
* restart the `print spooler`
* reinstall the new drivers and test again

### third solution

* open `printer management`
* in `View tab` Select `Custom View` and tick `Console tree` and `Action panel` (not mandatory)
* within `All Drivers` navigate to your printer driver (the one to be deleted): (Print Management > Custom Filters > All Drivers)
* right click your printer (in `Driver Name` column)
* from the `Driver Isolation` drop-down menu, select `Isolated`
* within `All Printers` navigate to your printer (the one to be deleted)
* right click your printer (in `Printer Name` column)
* select `Properties` (or `Manage Sharing`)
* in `Sharing` tab, de-select `Share this printer` and select `Apply` (Then patiently wait for it to `apply`)
* in `Advanced` tab, select `Print directly to the printer` and select `Apply` (Then patiently wait for it to `apply`) [This disables spooling (for this printer), so you can leave the `Print spooler` (`Spooler` in Task Manager) service still running]
* within `All Printers` right click your printer and perform `Delete`
* within `All Drivers` right click your printer and perform `Delete`
* if still not fixed, also try this: In `Properties` > `Security` tab, allow `Manage this printer`
