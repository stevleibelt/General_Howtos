# Desktop notification

You can use `wall "My message"` to write each user a message on the command line.

On the desktop, there are [multiple](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications) desktop notification systems or deamons.

You can use `notify-send` if your system is running a notification server. If you don't have one, you can install the [notification-daemon](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/notification-daemon/).
