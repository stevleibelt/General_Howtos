# Linux power management

## How is a suspend mode triggered and which parts are used

* You have a acpi event list located in `/etc/acpi/handler.sh`
  * This file is used from `/etc/acpi/events/anything`
* Depending on the acpi events, there is a high chance that `systemd-logind` is called
  * You can configure `logind` via `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`

### Check if acpi event for lid closed has has reached logind

* Close your lid
* Type in `sudo journalctl -b | grep -i 'lid\|suspend'`
* Expected lines are
  * `[...] Lid closed.`
  * `[...] Suspending [...]`

## List of power states

* freeze - suspend to idle
* standby - power on suspend
* mem - suspend to ram
* disk - suspend to disk

## How does suspend to disk work work under linux?

Linux is dumping the whole memory into your swap file or swap partition.
On the reboot, the kernel is searching for a "suspend-to-disk" image and loads them.

## Manually suspend to ram or disk

### Fetch supported power states

```bash
#all listed modes are the on your system support
cat /sys/power/state
```

### Suspend to your favorit mode

```bash
echo <mode> > /sys/power/state
```

### Suspend to disk

First of all, your swap has to have at least the size of your memory.

```bash
#raw method
echo /dev/<identifier of your swap partition> > /sys/power/resume
####
#with grub
#edit: /etc/default/grub
#add something like the following: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/sdc2"
#and rebuild your grub config with: grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Change the way how your pc reacts on acpi events (like pushing a button)

Edit the file /etc/acpi/handler.sh (e.g. unmounting network drives etc.).
