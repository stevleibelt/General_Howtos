# LibreELEC

* started as a fork of [OpenELEC](http://openelec.tv/)
* called as [JeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_enough_operating_system) for [kodi](https://kodi.tv/)
* available also for [raspberry pi](https://libreelec.tv/downloads/pi1-pi0/)

```
[...]
After OSMC this is the second large-scale fork of OpenELEC, but unlike OSMC the aim of this new LibreELEC fork is to become a registered non-profit organization.
