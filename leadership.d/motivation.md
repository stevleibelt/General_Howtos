# Ways to motivate

## To Lead and not to manage

Managing is like checking if resource a is transformed into b by worker c.
Leading is more like motivating by his own actions and contributions by reaching a shared goal.

## Outline a clear goal the team wants to reach

Instead of order tasks to do, explain and describe the benefits of reaching the goal behind the task. Who things are done is not as important as to distribute a clear vision aka the final goal for this project.

## Do not get into the way of a persons daily work, only provide the direction

This is like outline the clear goal but it is more focused on "let the people do their job the way they want it". Do not try to micromanage their routine the way you would like to do it.

## Do not forget to give positiv and public feedback

Giving feedback is good, don't get fooled by the idea that "no negativ feedback is a positiv feedback". Everybody wants to know he has done a good job. Even better, make the positiv feedback public.
