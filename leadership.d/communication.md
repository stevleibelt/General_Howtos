# Communication, the good parts

## Only provide informations with value to people who want it

You don't have to do marketing, provide informations with value. Everybody has a high workload and don't want to waste time by spending time on marketing mails telling you nothing.
Spamming all the company people is a bad way, provide a "opt in" way instead of an "opt out" to only reach the people who are interested in.


## Try to achive a two way communication

Not only writing a newsletter or a releasemail, create an environment where everyone from within the company can give feedback.

## Inspire, motivate and empower people

By giving people the chance to give feedback on informations with value, they want to share ideas. Give them the place to do so and see how they organize themself and start sharing solutions for internal issues everyone is trying to solve a bit differently (based on their knowledge).
