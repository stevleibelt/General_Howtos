# Time Well Spend

## The Manifesto

```
We live in an attention economy where products or websites win by getting our time. It's a race to the bottom of the brain stem to hijack our mind.

We're left constantly distracted.

Either we connect, but constantly get sucked in. Or we unplug, but lose all the benefits of technology completely.

We've had enough. We need to restore choice.

We believe in a new kind of design, that lets us connect without getting sucked in. And disconnect, without missing something important.

And we believe in a new kind economy that’s built to help us spend time well, where products compete to help us live by our values.

Let's start that conversation now.
```

## What Is The Difference?

| | with time spend | with time well spent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| design goal | we design to keep users active and hooked, while helping them complete tasks | we design to help users live their life and spend time well, while gaining their loyalty and business. |
| ability to disconnect | we expect users to be connected 24/7. if they want to disconnect, they can turn of their phone. | we empower users to disconnect without missing important things. |
| quality of attention | we slice peoples attention into frequent short bursts of attention; who says short bursts are worse than long and continuous uses? | we treat peoples attention as sacred and minimize task-switchting and interruptions. |
| success metrics | we measure success in terms of number of transactions (clicks, sales, time spent, or daily use) | we measure success in terms of lasting benefits that land concretely in peoples lives, while minimally use their time. | 
| business model | wel sell peoples attention to advertisers, so we need as much of it as possible. | we use business models that don't force us to maximize how much attention we get: payments, subscription or support from other revenue streams. | 
| framing of choices | disempowering choices that releate to what business cares about. | empowering choices that relate to what people care about in their lives. |
| self-deception and greenwashing | we believe our mission statement explains our impact on users' lives. | we have a mission question that lets us humbly get in tough with our holistic impact on user's live |
| dignity & respect | users are sheep we can influence with conversion funnnels. We design to manipulate them. | users are people whose attention, choices, relationships and livers are scared. We design to empower them. | 
| explanation of people's choices | Users' choices reflect their own free will. | Users' choices reflect the menu, situation and concext from which they choose. |
| default & responsibility | default settings don't matter. it's the user's responsibility to get the most out of the product; even if most people won't know how and it takes effort. | default settings matter. It's our responsibility to help the majority of people get the most out of the product with the least effort. |
| psychological externalities | It's users' responsibility to reduce anxieties and compulisons that come from using our products. | It's our responsiblity to reduce anxieties and compulsions that come from using our products. |

## How To Prepare Your Phone

* turn of notifications, except from persons/people (remove machines or businesses from steeling your attention)
* create a tools only home screen (limit your home screen to 4 to 6 tools you use frequently to get things done. move all other applications away into folders)
* open other applications by typing (open applications by typing filters out uncoscious and spontaneous choices while keeping conscious ones)
* limit the number of applications by two pages (if you have more than two pages, you are swiping back and forth mindlessly. The first page should contain your tools, the second folders)
* keep the m&m's, but hide the wrappers (colorful icons trigger our mind to use the unconsciously. move them inside folders.)
* stop leaky interactions (open your camera or alarm without unlocking your phone to keep the focous on the things you want to do)
* use clear unambiguous vibrations (create different vibrations to distinguish between important messages from peoples versus unimportant messages from machines or business)
* buy a travel alarm clock and charge outside the bedroom (avoid starting the day badly by checking your phone, get a separate alarm clock and leave your phone outside to charge)
* know your bottomless bowls and slot machines (know which apps are bottomless bowls (trapdoors) and slot machines (constant checking and steeling your time) for you. move them off the first page of apps)
