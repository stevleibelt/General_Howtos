# Tables in markdown

* There is no official support for tables in markdown (markdown extra)
* Following examples are widely implemented and accepted

### Example one

header one | header two
--- | ---
entry 0 0 | entry 0 1
entry 1 0 | entry 1 1

### Github flavored tables

| :--- | :----: | ---: |
| entry 0 0 0 | entry 0 1 0 | entry 0 1 1 |
| entry 1 0 0 | entry 1 1 0 | entry 1 1 1 |
| a super long entry to show the left align | another super long entry to show the center align | and a final super long entry to show the right align |
