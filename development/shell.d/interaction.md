# input / output redirection

## basics

0   -   stdin / standard input
1   -   stdout / standard output
2   -   stderr / standard error

## twist

```
ls -l > foo.bar # stdout redirection of 'ls -l' into file 'foo.bar'

ls -l foo 2>/dev/null   # stderr redirection - prevent error message "ls: cannot access foo: No such file or directory"

ls -l foo 2>&1  # stderr redirection - redirect stderr to stdout

ls -l foo >/dev/null 2>&1  # redirection of stderr to stdout and stdout with stderr to /dev/null ("1>" the 1 is optional, if not exists, stdout is taken as default)

ls -l foo 2>&1 >/dev/null   # redirection of stderr to stdout and stdout to /dev/null (stderr gets displayed on the screen!)

wc -c < /dev/null   # stdint redirection - redirect content of a file to word cound
```

# pipes

```
ls -l | more    # connect stdout of 'ls -l' with stdin of 'more'
```

# wildcards

* ?             -   wildcard for single character (must exist)
* *             -   wildcard for one or infinite number characters

* [1-4]         -   wildcard for allowing '1', '2', '3' and '4' (also valid with characters)
* [!a2]         -   wildcard for not allowing 'a' or '2' (also valid to write it like [^a2]
* [a-fy-z2]     -   example for allowing 'a' to 'f', 'y' to 'z' and '2'
* [a^]          -   example if you need the '^' as character (same with [a!])
* [a]]          -   example if you need the ']' as character
* [[a]          -   example if you need the '[' as character
* [a-]          -   example if you need the '-' as character
* [[:alnum:]]   -   letters, numbers and _
* [[:alpha:]]   -   letters (case insensitive)
* [[:digit:]]   -   numbers
* [[:lower:]]   -   lower letters
* [[:print:]]   -   all printable characters
* [[:space:]]   -   whitespace, tab and so one
* [[:upper:]]   -   upper letters

# braces extension

```
echo stev{e,o}  # output: steve stev-o

touch /tmp/foo/{bar{.baz,.foo},baz{.foo,.bar}}   # creates files: bar.baz, bar.foo, baz.foo, baz.bar
```
