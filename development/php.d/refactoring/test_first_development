#why?
tests will decrease the time you have to spend for fixing bugs.
communicate with your customer and show functional tests as early as possible. If you have code covered by tests, you are not afraid to change anything inside.

#put the chaos in the cage
cover code with unit tests and functional tests (selenium, phantomjs)

#how?
create a unittest that should cover the new functionality -> test should run red
implement functionality -> test should run green
refactor code as long as tests are green
