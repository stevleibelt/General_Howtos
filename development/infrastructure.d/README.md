# Things to avoid

## Don't belive the marketings, the cloud is not an option for big business

The cloud could be a good way to go for high peaks stuff. But never make the fail to not invest in local hardware, software and people who are able to use both.
Only things in you control can be scaled to the need your daily workload needs to be without throwing money out of the window or optimize your applications to this dedicated cloud hoster.

## Don't get locked into the cloud providers jail

When you start adapting your code or your tools to fit the cloud providers requirements, you should take this as a warning signal.
Like for every partner or contract you sign, you should have a "plan b" available if the partner is not available anymore (of if the coast is to high, the infrastructure is to complicated to speed up your tasks etc.).

## Do not use the newest technologies unless they really solve the one problem without changing anything

Even don't use tools you can not controll that are not older than 18 months. Ask yourself if the trade off is high enough to spend the amount of time to implement the usage of this tool.
How proof is this tool.

## Figure out how to break things

Having a working software is nice. But it is better to know how and when this software is breaking (know the limits).


## Test and monitor first development

Instead of focus on "how to test" only, you also have to focus on how to monitor the code (how long does it take to process the data and provide a result).
Make "enable verbosity" a mantra on your development process.
Make your code ready to help tracing user/worker ids to illustrate the flow of data.
Add the internal and external performance (e.g. network time for each transaction) to the stack trace.
