# Kanban for home use

* create a board
    * having the backlog on the right side is a psychological trick
    * you are reading from left to right, it is better to see the finished things first
    * optional, you can hide the backlog behind a door or a curtian
* write tasks
    * be explicit (to define the definition of done)
    * write it in the "is done" and not in the "need to do" form
* assign storypoins to each task (1, 2, 5, 8, 13)
    * advice, if you add 8 or 13 story points, it looks like your task is a story, split it up into tasks
* limit the number of tasks you can move to "in progress"
* make reviews each week (or two weeks)
    * note your storypoints with comments like "holiday, ill etc." do determine a trend and get your current speed

## what do you need

* most simple solution (also good for a tryout)
    * use stickers
* a bit more advanced
    * magnetic background
    * one color of magnets per person and one for the backlog (not linked to a person)
* even more advanced
    * a whiteboard
    * one color per person and one for the backlog

## advices

* also add "funny" or enjoyable tasks like "having a dinner for two" - life is more than work ;-)
* keep in mind, an epic is a collection of stories, a story is a collection of tasks
* if you have to add an "and" or an "or" in your tasks definition of done, there is a chance you should write two tasks
