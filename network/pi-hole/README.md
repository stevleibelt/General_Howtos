## Configuration files

```
/etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.conf
```

# Installation

## Via Podman

```

```

## On Archlinuxarm

```
mkdir -p software/source/org/archlinux/aur
cd software/source/org/archlinux/aur
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/pi-hole-ftl.git
cd pi-hole-server
makepkg -Csri
sudo pacman -U *.tar.xz
cd ../
#if you want to have webserver to
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/pi-hole-server.git
cd pi-hole-server
makepkg -Csri
sudo pacman -U *.tar.xz
```

# Testing

You should run the tests once with providing the ip address of your pi-hole and a second time without providing the ip address of your pi-hole.   
If both tests are generating the right results, you have verified that all clients using the pi-hole as dns server.

## Linux

```
# should work
dig @<ip of pi-hole> google.com

# should be blocked
dig @<ip of pi-hole> s.amazon-adsystem.com
```

## Windows

```
# should work
Resolve-DnsName -Server <ip of pi-hole> -Name google.com 

# should be blocked
Resolve-DnsName -Server <ip of pi-hole> -Name s.amazon-adsystem.com
```

# Error fixing

## DNS resolution fails

If you could please try the following steps:

    Restore /etc/resolve.conf to its initial default state - contains:
    nameserver 127.0.0.1

    Check that /etc/systemd/resolved.conf contains
    DNSStubHandler=no

    Force a reload of all of systemd-resolved's configuration files
    sudo systemctl reload-or-restart systemd-resolved

    Repair Pi-hole (to ensure dnsmasq's config files are correct)
    pihole -r

    Then, if you could please report the output of
    systemctl status dnsmasq.service systemd-resolved

Should they not both be running:

    if you could please try:
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    then once again
    pihole -r

    and once again, please report the output of
    systemctl status dnsmasq.service systemd-resolved
```
